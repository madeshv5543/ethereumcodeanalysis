![image](picture/sign_state_3.png) is the state of t+1 (account trie).

![image](picture/sign_state_4.png) is a state transition function and can also be understood as an execution engine.

![image](picture/sign_state_5.png) is transaction, one transaction.

![image](picture/sign_state_6.png)

![image](picture/sign_state_7.png) is a state transition function at the block level.

![image](picture/sign_state_8.png) is a block that consists of many transactions.

![image](picture/sign_state_9.png) The transaction at position 0.

![image](picture/sign_state_10.png) is the block termination state transition function (a function that rewards the miner).

## Some basic rules

- For most functions, they are identified by uppercase letters.
- Tuples are generally identified by capital letters
- Scalar or fixed-size byte arrays are identified by lowercase letters. For example, n represents the nonce of the transaction, and there may be some exceptions, such as δ representing the amount of stack data required for a given instruction.
- Variable-length byte arrays are generally bolded with lowercase letters. For example, **o** represents the output data of a message call. It is also possible to use bold uppercase letters for some important things.
